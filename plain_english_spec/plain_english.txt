The Ping-Pong method counts from 1 to a given number.
For example, we expect an input of 2 to return the array [1, 2].

The Ping-Pong method will replace multiples of 3 with the string "ping", multiples
of 5 with the string "pong", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with the string 'ping-pong'

To determine which numbers are multiples of 3 and 5 we will use modulo method. For example
if <number>.%(3)=0 it should return "ping", if <number>.%(5)=0 it should return
with "pong" and if <number>.%(3)=0 AND <number>.%(5)=0 it should return "ping-pong"
